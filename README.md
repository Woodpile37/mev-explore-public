# Contribute to MEV-Explore

Hey! Thanks for your interest in contributing to MEV-Explore.

For starters, we recommend you to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7hvTycdNcK) and to check out MEV-Explore's [Metholodogy](https://explore.flashbots.net/methodology) page for an explanation of how we've arrived at this dashboard.

Below is a list of all the ways you can help us with MEV-Explore:

## Help us improve our protocol coverage by contributing to the Inspect codebase

Inspectors currently missing include:
* Swerve arbitrage
* Bancor arbitrage
* Kyber Network arbitrage
* DyDx liquidations
* Mooniswap arbitrage
* DODO arbitrage
* ESD/DSD incentivized frontrunning calls

Review our existing code for any mistakes in there or in the tests we do. Our code for MEV-Inspect exists mostly in Rust.

## Help us improve our data by spotting false positives

Our approach is far from perfect and we need as much help we can get in spotting false positive. You can see individual transactions we classify in the Leaderboard page of the dashboard.

If you spot any transactions with a revenue that seems different from the one you seem to find, or that isn't a MEV txs at all. Please add it to the misclassified txs Github issue opened accessible [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs/issues/13)!

## Help us improve our data visualizations

Suggest new visualizations you'd like to see in Explore or new metrics that would be interesting to you over [here](https://mev-explore.convas.io/).

MEV-Explore is a public tool we aim to iterate on based on the feedback we receive from you.
